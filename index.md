[My Projects](https://github.com/hedgenull/)

### Programming Languages I've Made:
- [Cobalt](https://github.com/hedgenull/cobalt/): Small, from-scratch language that transpiles to Python.
- [MochaScript](https://github.com/hedgenull/mochascript/): Small but powerful language where everything's an expression.
- [SkeedgeScript](https://github.com/hedgenull/skeedgescript/): Accumulative, esoteric language where you can only use "skeedge."
- [Fractal9](https://github.com/hedgenull/fractal9/): In a nutshell, obfuscated Forth.

### Games I've Made:
- [Grey Dungeons](https://github.com/hedgenull/grey-dungeons): A text-adventure game with hidden jokes that you probably won't understand.
- [BreakOut](https://github.com/hedgenull/breakout/): Atari Breakout clone with some new features.
- [Alien Invasion](https://github.com/hedgenull/alieninvasion/): Space Invaders clone from [_Python Crash Course_](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition) by Eric Matthes.
